            <p>Are these sites telling the whole story? Partly.<br>
                Potential customers are checking you out online.
                They want to know what other people think so they turn to sites like Google, Facebook, Trip Advisor, Angieâ€™s List and Yelp.

                        This was a great experience. I explained to Gregg what I was looking for and he brought samples with him that
                        met my criteria exactly as to product quality and price. He was very knowledeable about the products and very easy
                        to work with. I was able to schedule the work within two weeks of signing the contract and they were 
                        able to do the demo and installation in two days.
